How to format a neural network model's weights and biases

Note: the connections and nodes in the program are always ordered in the same way, making this very simple

1. list all weights

e.g.

0.03 0.02 -0.04 0.06 -0.01

the model will go through each connection in it's lists of connections and set the weights

2. list biases of hidden nodes

e.g.

-0.2 0.4 0.1 -0.3

the model will go through each hidden node and update the bias
